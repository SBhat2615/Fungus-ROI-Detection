# Fungus-ROI-Detection

##### OBSERVATIONS #####

- In the final ROI prediction, check the total area of the bbox (since number of bbox vary a lot)
- Usual bounding boxes may not be suitable for the work
-



##### THINGS TO TRY #####

- Bounding box method using roboflow (Give json annotation to roboflow)
- Bounding box method on custom object without roboflow (Local machine / Google colab)
- Object Detection using Polygon labelling
- Build a segmentation model -> Build ROI using that segmentation



##### PTR #####

- Best model for curvilinear object detection (retinal curves, cornial curves, aerial view of roads & ferries)
- Compare between different YOLO models
- Compare between submodels for a model 
- Different annotation tools
