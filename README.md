# Fungus-ROI-Detection


##### OBSERVATIONS #####

- Usual bounding boxes may not be suitable for the work (overal density vary a lot (low -> high))
-
-



##### THINGS TO TRY #####

- Bounding box method using roboflow (Give json annotation to roboflow)
- Bounding box method on custom object without roboflow (Own machine or Google colab)
  - Improvise the bounding box
- Object Detection using Polygon labelling
- Build a segmentation model -> Build ROI using that segmentation



##### PTR #####

- Best model for curvilinear object detection (retinal curves, cornial curves, aerial view of roads & ferries)
- Compare between different YOLO models
- Compare between submodels for a model 
- Different annotation tools
